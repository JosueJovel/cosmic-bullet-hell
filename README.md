# Psychic Shooter Man

## Finished

### Player GameObject
#### Summary

- Sprite
- Collider2D
- Movement 
- Movement Speed

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### In-depth

- Sprite Renderer component (triangle sprite, but can be replaced with
    other sprites)
- Polygon Collider 2D (shaped into triangle, but can be shaped to
    conform to other sprites)
- Player.cs script

So far, the Player.cs script just controls movement and movement speed.
Other functionality can be added in the future though.
The speed variable can be adjusted within the Unity UI as well under the
Player.cs script component.

May add RigidBody2D component in future.

Commented out code in Player.cs is a different implementation of the
same functionality. Will probably remove in the future.
